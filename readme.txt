How to run the files?
Just be at the correct path next to the makefile
then you have two opitons
1- either to run the file from floppy
2- or to run the file from drive

then the stages will run in front of you on a virtual machine screen
you will need to press keys in order to move on to the next stage of the project
then it will hang at the end
